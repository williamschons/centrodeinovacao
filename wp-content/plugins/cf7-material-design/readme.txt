**How does it work?**

Our plugin adds a specially selected style sheet and a script from the materialize.css library. However, we had to implement certain modifications. For instance, we  improved the selectors, because the themes tend to interfere with plugin styles. Despite this improvement, certain element may  slightly differ form the original. If that is the case, you can contact us or strengthen style sheet rules of our plugin on your own. In the next step we changed the output of the Contact Form 7. We tested it on many templates. It works properly as we expected.
